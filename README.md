# youtube_cli_flask

## History
<p> This project started as a custom media server created using flask and vlc to allow youtube streaming via terminal in search of creating a server even worked on less powerful devices like RaspberryPi.</p>

## RoadMap
<p>Currently as for Stage I expect to make a "music.youtube.com" like app that works in India too and plays only mp3 music incorporating Youtube Suggestion too using Youtube API's or scrapping if required. </p>

## Installation
* Just use the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt ` to install the dependecies

* And use ` python3 server.py ` to start the server.
